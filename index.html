      <p>MacGyver's birthdate is first seen as January 23, 1951, but was then revised in season 2 as March 23, 1952. He is a lifelong player of ice hockey, having played in his local hockey leagues and coached for a minor league team; he is also a supporter of the Calgary Flames and believed he could have made the NHL.
      </p>
      <p>MacGyver went to Western Tech where he graduated with a dual degree in Chemistry and Physics. After graduating from college he turned down an offer to work at the nearby nuclear power plant and it is later revealed that he shortly served during the Vietnam War in a bomb-defusing team. When MacGyver saves Thornton's life using a paper clip, a wrench and shoelaces, MacGyver is offered a job as a field agent at the DXS.

      <p>MacGyver has a genius-level intellect and a particular ability for adaptation and improvisation. He is a resourceful U.S. operative who works for the Phoenix Foundation, a covert U.S. government agency operating under the guise of a think tank. Trained as an EOD technician for the Army, Mac prefers to use non-lethal means to stop his enemies and refuses to carry a gun, though if necessary he will resort to lethal measures. He is never without his trusty Swiss Army knife and uses anything in his environment to his advantage. While not an expert in biology or medicine, MacGyver is shown to be an efficient field medic and knowledgeable in crime scene techniques and DNA sequencing procedures.</p>
